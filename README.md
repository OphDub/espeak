# Espeak [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OphDub/espeak2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OphDub/espeak2)

## Synopsis

This application is a group capstone project where we have leveraged the skills we have learned over the course of Turing. The purpose of Espeak is to provide users with a way to learn and practice their Spanish vocabulary. The front end was built in React Native, the back end was built in SQL and Knex, and we used Firebase for authorization for users. After creating an account and logging in, a user can go through the flash cards we have set up for them to practice their Spanish vocabulary.
